    <h3> POP MUSIC HIGHLIGHTS</h3>
    <p>Zayn Malik has announced a week-long residency in Las Vegas in January.

The former One Direction singer has only toured solo once since leaving the band, on last year's Stairway to the Sky shows.

Posting on Instagram, the artist announced he would be performing at the Dolby Live venue at the Park MGM Hotel.

Other artists, including Adele, Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga have all done residencies in Las Vegas.</p>
Although Zayn's residency is shorter, fans have been posting online suggesting that it is a sign of a bigger comeback.

Zayn originally from Bradford, England, caused another stir with the fanbase recently when he was spotted in the US with former band mate Louis Tomlinson.

Fans launched into a frenzy of speculation, predicting a collab or new music from the pair.

It is believed to be the only time the two had been spotted together in public in a casual setting since One Direction's hiatus in 2015.

The only other occasion was at former bandmate Liam Payne's funeral last year.

This week, Zayn, 32, also released a new song - Break Free - to tie in with the release of video game Borderlands 4.

A self-proclaimed lifelong gamer, Zayn told US entertainment magazine Variety when he's not working or with his daughter his "usual place is in front of the console, gaming with my friends back home in the UK".

    <h3>CULTURAL ARTICLE ON BINDI</h3>

    <p>By the mid-20th century, the bindi began to undergo a significant transformation.
The bindi, a small decorative mark worn on the forehead, has been an integral part of South Asian culture for over 5,000 years. This distinctive symbol, which originated in the Indian subcontinent, transcends its ornamental purpose to embody deep cultural, spiritual, and social significance that continues to resonate in modern times.</p>
The word ‘bindi’ derives from the Sanskrit term ‘bindu,’ meaning point or dot. In ancient Hindu texts, the space between the eyebrows is considered the location of the sixth chakra, Ajna, or the ‘third eye’ — a powerful energy center associated with concealed wisdom and divine sight. Applying bindi in this location was believed to strengthen one’s concentration and retain energy.

Historically, the traditional bindi was created using vermillion powder, also known as ‘sindoor,’ which holds its sacred significance in Hindu culture. The red colour symbolised honour, love, and prosperity, while also serving as a marker of married women in many communities.
